# 🚨 Quick Fix: Switch to SQLite Temporarily

## Current Issue
Both Render and Railway can't reach your Supabase database:
```
Network is unreachable to db.hduukqxhrebuifafooxv.supabase.co:6543
```

This suggests a Supabase configuration issue, not a hosting platform issue.

## ⚡ IMMEDIATE FIX: Use SQLite

### In Railway Dashboard:

**Add this environment variable:**
```
USE_SQLITE=true
```

**Remove/Delete these variables:**
```
DATABASE_URL
SUPABASE_URL
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
SUPABASE_KEY
```

**Keep these:**
```
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
FLASK_ENV=production
GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSyBfX075CjZZM7kNJlAUT1U20siZA3DkASw
PORT=8080
```

## 🎯 Expected Result:
```
🔍 USE_SQLITE flag: true
🔗 Using SQLite database (forced by USE_SQLITE flag)
✅ Database tables created successfully
✅ Default admin user created successfully
✅ Login/Signup works perfectly!
```

## 🔍 Supabase Troubleshooting (After SQLite Works)

Once your app works with SQLite, let's check your Supabase:

1. **Supabase Dashboard → Settings → Database**
2. **Check Connection Info:**
   - Host: `db.hduukqxhrebuifafooxv.supabase.co`
   - Port: Try both `5432` and `6543`
   - Make sure database is running

3. **Network Settings:**
   - Enable "Allow connections from anywhere"
   - Check if there are IP restrictions

4. **Try Direct Connection Test:**
   Use a PostgreSQL client to test connection directly

## 💡 Alternative Database Options:

If Supabase keeps having issues:

### Option 1: Railway PostgreSQL (Free)
- Add PostgreSQL service in Railway
- Copy DATABASE_URL to your app
- Fully managed by Railway

### Option 2: Neon Database (Free)
- Better connectivity than Supabase
- PostgreSQL compatible
- Free tier available

## 🚀 Action Plan:

1. **First:** Set `USE_SQLITE=true` in Railway → Test login works
2. **Then:** Investigate Supabase connectivity issues
3. **Finally:** Choose best database solution

The immediate goal is to get your app working, then we can fix the database connection properly.
